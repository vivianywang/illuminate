#This project is to help with the limited accessibility to healthcare systems. At any point in time, the user can input whatever symptom they're feeling to keep track. They can see all of their past symptoms along with the days that they occured. Then, there is a built in "possible sickness" tool where the user is able to tell the program what symptoms they're feeling. Then, the program will come up with a possible sickness(es) and will give treatment you could go through at home, without the help of a doctor.
